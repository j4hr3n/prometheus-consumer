# v2.0.0 Release notes

## Description

This release is centered around removing global state.

## tl;dr

Changes in this release:

-   prom-client global state removed
-   .metrics() method added
-   .contentType() method added
-   lint fixing

Usage of this module changes from:

```js
const promClient = require('prom-client');
const metricsConsumer = new PrometheusConsumer({ client: promClient });

client.pipe(metricsConsumer);

app.get('/metrics', (req, res) => {
    res.set('Content-Type', promClient.register.contentType).send(
        promClient.register.metrics(),
    );
});
```

to:

```js
const promClient = require('prom-client');
const metricsConsumer = new PrometheusConsumer({ client: promClient });

client.pipe(metricsConsumer);

app.get('/metrics', (req, res) => {
    res.set('Content-Type', metricsConsumer.contentType()).send(
        metricsConsumer.metrics(),
    );
});
```

## Changes

This release has the following changes

### global state removal

In previous versions, this module used prom-client's global registry to hold all collected metrics. This had the potential to collide with other usages of prom-client.
In this version, a new isolated registry is created for each consumer instance.

### .metrics() and .contentType() methods added

In order to support using an isolated registry it was necessary to add a method to extract and render gathered metrics for scraping.
Instead of rendering metrics out of the global registry you can call `.metrics()`. In order to set the correct content type for the content you can use `.contentType()`

_Example_

```js
app.get('/metrics', (req, res) => {
    res.set('Content-Type', consumer.contentType()).send(consumer.metrics());
});
```

### lint cleanup

Several files were linted to AirBnB standard
